TODO:

1. Set up the state-of-the-art music genre classifier to evaluate our output? 
2. Write the proposal 
3. Set up the neural network that someone has made that should work much better than our baseline 
   (maybe http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/)
